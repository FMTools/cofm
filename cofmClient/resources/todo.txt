Things I need to do for model list and creation:
1. Create UI for creating new model, so that I can have some "real" data on the server.
<DONE> Search: the others-model list will display the results (note that search result will omit my models)
    if search returns null, display the "create model form" to create the model.
<DONE> 2. Call ListModelCommand and ListUserCommand in the proper place in order to get these real data.
<DONE> 3. Complete the Login UI for user login.
<DONE> 4. Complete the Register UI and RegisterCommand so that I can add some users. 
5. Insert code for listening events and hiding/showing proper UI components, in detail:
	Startup: show ConnectDlg and hide others.
	When connected: show Login/Register form, others-model list and hide others.
	When logined: show my-model-view(including a 'search-or-create' view), update other-model-list,
		and hide others.
6. Modify the server code of construction of the list model response: calculate primary name and
   description on the server so the network load can be greatly reduced.
7. Define default size for components.
