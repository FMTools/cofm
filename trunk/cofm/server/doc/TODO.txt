1. Generate extra operations for commit action:
1.1 Modify CommitAction as "VoteRule.txt" says.
1.2 In Feature
voteXXX except voteExistence on the feature will also call voteExistence(true) on it.

2. Init a root feature (name is "root") for dp and client. 

3. The client should send request according to a "script" file, which contains predefined requests.
This will enable us to generate different request sequences without modifying the code.
