Introduction
The Java 2 platform includes a collections framework. A collection is an object that represents a group of objects (such as the classic Vector class). A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, allowing them to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. 
The primary advantages of a collections framework are that it: 

Reduces programming effort by providing useful data structures and algorithms so you don't have to write them yourself. 
Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of useful data structures and algorithms. Because the various implementations of each interface are interchangeable, programs can be easily tuned by switching implementations. 
Provides interoperability between unrelated APIs by establishing a common language to pass collections back and forth. 
Reduces the effort required to learn APIs by eliminating the need to learn multiple ad hoc collection APIs. 
Reduces the effort required to design and implement APIs by eliminating the need to produce ad hoc collections APIs. 
Fosters software reuse by providing a standard interface for collections and algorithms to manipulate them.
